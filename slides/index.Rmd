#check model diagnostics (assumptions)

### 1: The regression model is linear in parameters -- *yes!*

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
s_model |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = skewness, y = cog) +
  geom_point() # add geom scatter plot
```

---

### 2: The mean of residuals is zero -- *yes, close to zero!*

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(scipen = 999)
mean(s_model$residuals)
```


---

### 3: Homoskedasticity of residuals or equal variance --- *yes, spread of residuals is the same above and below the line!*

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
diagnosis(s_model)
```

---

### 4: No autocorrelation of residuals: *Durbin-Watson test is not significant, no autocorrelation!*

```{r}
dwtest(s_model)
```

---

### 5: Predictor and residuals are not correlated: *confirmed, correlation is near 0 so we know predictor and residuals are not correlated!*

```{r}
cor.test(s_data$skewness, residuals(s_model))
```

---

### 6: Normality of residuals: *confirmed, residuals look approximately normally distributed*

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
diagnosis(s_model)
summary(s_model)
```

### 7: General description of results

#### 
Data from fricatives were analyzed using a linear model. The model included center of gravity measurement in Hz for [s] as the dependent variable and skewness measurement for [s] as the independent variable. Visual inspection of Q-Q plots and plots of residuals against fitted values revealed no discernible deviations from normality and homoskedasticity. Additional diagnostics confirmed linearity, a near-zero mean of residuals, no autocorrelation, and no correlation between the predictor and residuals. We report p-values with alpha set as 0.05.

Figure 1 (see slide 9) shows center of gravity as a function of skewness for [s]. 

The model revealed a significant fixed effect of skewness . Specifically, higher skewness was associated with higher center of gravity values of [s] (*B* = 1675.60, SE = 139.40, *p* < .001). The model accounted for approximately 75% of the variance in center of gravity (RÂ² = 0.75).

# assumptions dataset

```{r, echo=FALSE}
assumptions_data <- read_csv("../data_raw/fricatives/assumptions.csv")
str(assumptions_data)
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
assumptions_data |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = x, y = y) +
  geom_point()
```

### The relationship between x and y is definitely not linear. It is actually a dinosaur relationship! We cannot fit a linear model to this dataset.
